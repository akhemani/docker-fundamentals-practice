# Docker Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains a simple web application and the necessary configuration files to containerize and deploy it using Docker. This project serves as a hands-on lab to demonstrate key Docker concepts, including:

* Building custom Docker images
* Container networking and port mapping
* Using Docker volumes for data persistence
* Multi-container applications with Docker Compose
* Pushing images to a container registry

---

## Project Structure

* **`web-app/`**: Contains the source code for the application.
    * `app-source-file`: The application's main entry point.
    * `dependencies-file`: A list of dependencies required by the application.
    * `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image.
    * `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration for a multi-container application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Docker:** Ensure you have Docker Desktop (for Mac/Windows) or Docker Engine (for Linux) installed on your machine.

### Building and Running

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name/web-app
    ```

2.  Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-web-app:v1.0 .
    ```

3.  Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name web-app my-web-app:v1.0
    ```
    The application will now be accessible on `http://localhost:5000`.

4.  To test the multi-container setup, use Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start the web application and a supporting service (such as a caching service), demonstrating how multiple containers can work together within a custom network.

## Key Concepts Explored

* **Containerization:** Packaging an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit.
* **Images & Containers:** The distinction between a Docker image (a template) and a container (a running instance of an image).
* **Networking:** How containers communicate with each other and with the host machine.
* **Volumes:** Persisting data generated by containers.
* **Docker Compose:** Defining and running multi-container applications as a single, cohesive service.
